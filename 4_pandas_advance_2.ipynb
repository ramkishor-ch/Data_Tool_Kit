       "  'body': \"### Pandas version checks\\n\\n- [X] I have checked that the issue still exists on the latest versions of the docs on `main` [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/)\\n\\n\\n### Location of the documentation\\n\\nhttps://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html#pandas.DataFrame.groupby\\r\\nhttps://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/user_guide/groupby.html#\\n\\n### Documentation problem\\n\\nIn my broad view of things, groupby can work on any (combination of) hashables, but there can be some unintuitive situations that should be mentioned in the docs.\\r\\n\\r\\nE.g., the following should and does work (work as in there is no exception, but the results are not necessarily as expected):\\r\\n```\\r\\n>>> df = pd.DataFrame({'a': [False, 1, True, 'string'], 'b': [1, 2, 3, 4]})\\r\\n        a  b\\r\\n0   False  1\\r\\n1       1  2\\r\\n2    True  3\\r\\n3  string  4\\r\\n\\r\\n# let's groupby on 'a':\\r\\n>>> df.groupby('a').describe()\\r\\n           b\\r\\n       count mean       std  min   25%  50%   75%  max\\r\\na\\r\\nFalse    1.0  1.0       NaN  1.0  1.00  1.0  1.00  1.0\\r\\n1        2.0  2.5  0.707107  2.0  2.25  2.5  2.75  3.0\\r\\nstring   1.0  4.0       NaN  4.0  4.00  4.0  4.00  4.0\\r\\n```\\r\\nWe can see that the value `1` and `True` were grouped together. From a Python background, that is not unexpected, as `1 == True` evaluates as `True`, i.e. `1` and `True` are equal and thus in the same group.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile this data layout may be questionable, it certainly happens in reality. I find myself often using (abusing?) `groupby()` on multiple cols to identify unique combinations of values, and in this case, I would not want `1` to be considered equal to `True` (or `0` equal to `False` and whichever other 'convenience' conversions Python does).\\r\\n\\n\\n### Suggested fix for documentation\\n\\n\\r\\nI think the docs could benefit from mentioning this pitfall. The suggested workaround that I see would be to first convert the columns to strings before the `groupby`:\\r\\n```\\r\\n>>> df.groupby(df['a'].apply(str)).describe()\\r\\n           b\\r\\n       count mean std  min  25%  50%  75%  max\\r\\na\\r\\n1        1.0  2.0 NaN  2.0  2.0  2.0  2.0  2.0\\r\\nFalse    1.0  1.0 NaN  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0\\r\\nTrue     1.0  3.0 NaN  3.0  3.0  3.0  3.0  3.0\\r\\nstring   1.0  4.0 NaN  4.0  4.0  4.0  4.0  4.0\\r\\n```\\r\\n\",\n",

As illustrated by the case with the `'string'` value, Pandas is lenient and sorts booleans and strings without complaining, which is not technically correct, and it would be convenient if this behavior is extended to other types.\\n\\n### Alternative Solutions\\n\\nI realize that the suggested change may be a conflicting one as the argument `sort=True` clearly requests a sorted output. For applications that would rely on this output being indeed sorted, it might be better to be more strict and keep having an error. In this case, however, it would be good to get a hint that `sort=False` would solve the issue. But then again, there's the issue that it currently is supported between non-sortable values (string vs bool), and for consistency, I would suggest the `sort` argument be ignored.\\n\\n### Additional Context\\n\\n_No response_\",\n",

It should return zero, but instead returns a value. \\r\\n\\r\\nSwitching to using the Pandas float32 dtype alleviates the error, as does using `np.std` on the numpy values of the series. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Expected Behavior\\r\\n\\r\\nThe expected behavior is the following evaluating to `True`\\r\\n```python\\r\\npd.Series([271.46] * 150000, dtype='float32').std() == 0.0\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Installed Versions\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : f538741432edf55c6b9fb5d0d496d2dd1d7c2457\\r\\npython                : 3.11.7.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Windows\\r\\nOS-release            : 10\\r\\nVersion               : 10.0.22621\\r\\nmachine               : AMD64\\r\\nprocessor             : Intel64 Family 6 Model 151 Stepping 5, GenuineIntel\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : None\\r\\nLOCALE                : English_United States.1252\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.0\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.3\\r\\npytz                  : 2023.3.post1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools            : 68.2.2\\r\\npip                   : 23.3.1\\r\\nCython                : None\\r\\npytest                : None\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : None\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\r\\nlxml.etree            : 4.9.3\\r\\nhtml5lib              : None\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : None\\r\\njinja2                : None\\r\\nIPython               : 8.15.0\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : None\\r\\nbottleneck            : 1.3.7\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : None\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : 3.8.0\\r\\nnumba                 : None\\r\\nnumexpr               : 2.8.7\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : None\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npyarrow               : None\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : 1.11.4\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : None\\r\\nxarray                : None\\r\\nxlrd                  : None\\r\\nzstandard             : None\\r\\ntzdata                : 2023.3\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n```\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\",\n",

In `pandas/_libs/tslibs/fields.pyx`, the way in which the start and end months were set was one way for freq 'MS', 'QS', and 'YS' than other offsets. However, only the latter two had the necessary properties to set start and end this way. As such, removing 'MS' from the list fixed the issue.\\r\\n\",\n",
